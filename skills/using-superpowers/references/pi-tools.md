# Pi Tool Mapping

Skills speak in actions ("dispatch a subagent", "create a todo", "read a file"). On Pi these resolve to the tools below.

| Action skills request | Pi equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Load a skill (`Skill` tool / "use skill") | Use the runtime's skill-loading mechanism if installed; otherwise read the relevant `SKILL.md` file directly |
| Dispatch a subagent (`Subagent (general-purpose):` template) | Use an installed subagent tool such as `subagent` from `pi-subagents` if available |
| Task tracking ("create a todo", "mark complete") | Use an installed todo/task tool if available, otherwise track tasks in the plan or `TODO.md` |
| Read/write/edit files | Use the Pi tools exposed for `read`, `write`, and `edit` actions |
| Run shell commands | Use the Pi shell tool for `bash` actions |

## Subagents

Pi core does not ship a standard subagent tool. The `pi-subagents` package is a strong optional companion and provides a `subagent` tool with single-agent, chain, parallel, async, forked-context, and resume/status workflows. If no subagent tool is available, do not fabricate `Task` calls; execute sequentially in the current session or explain that the optional subagent capability is not installed.

## Task lists

Pi core does not ship a standard task-list tool. If a todo/task extension is installed, use its documented tool. Otherwise use Superpowers plan files, checklists in Markdown, or a repo-local `TODO.md` for task tracking. Older Superpowers docs may refer to `TodoWrite`; treat that as the task-tracking action above.

Older Superpowers docs may also refer to a `Task` tool for subagents and lowercase `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash` tools for file and shell work. Treat those as action names: use the equivalent Pi runtime tool if installed.
